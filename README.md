# Nerdbeers-ember

Just an experiment at using Ember and Firebase to build a simple app.

This is not at all meant to disparage the fine work of the NerdBeers
development and operations team. It's only an experiment and not a
suggestion to change anything.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running / Development

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details

In particular `ember g scaffold` is very useful. You'd do something like
this:

```
ember g scaffold location name address url
```

### Running Tests

Running with the `--server` flag is th way to see the super cool browser
based test runner.

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Deploying

Specify what it takes to deploy your app.
